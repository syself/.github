[Syself](https://syself.com/) is building a simplified Kubernetes Management Platform, allowing you to build reliable environments with 100% reproducibility in just a few steps, no need for in-house experts. 

If you are interested in creating and upgrading highly available clusters with a single command, keep reading or [book a demo](https://syself.com/demo).

## ‚ú® Who we are

Syself is based in Germany, with a globally distributed team of experts. Strongly rooted in the open-source community, we use battle-tested and open software to bring automation and ease of use to our customers, with the utmost goal of making Kubernetes better for your business.

## ü§ñ Syself Autopilot: Easy, Production-ready & Reliable Kubernetes

Syself Autopilot is a powerful Kubernetes Management Platform designed to automate and streamline the complexities of managing production-grade infrastructure. Here‚Äôs how we deliver value to our partners:

- **Fully Automated, Production-Ready Clusters:** Syself Autopilot automates the creation and maintenance of Kubernetes clusters, ensuring they are secure, compliant, highly available and ready for production use immediately after deployment.
- **Expertise in Hetzner Integration:** Syself has been operating on Hetzner infrastructure for four years, running Kubernetes platforms that support around 40 million daily users. We‚Äôve developed a highly efficient Cluster API integration for Hetzner, which is now the second most used integration globally‚Äîranking ahead of Azure, Google, and DigitalOcean. This deep expertise allows us to leverage Hetzner‚Äôs extensive network, including locations in Germany, Finland, The United States, and Singapore, offering the most cost-effective bare-metal servers and virtual machines worldwide.
- **Tailored for AI/ML Workloads on Hetzner:** Our platform integrates seamlessly with Hetzner‚Äôs GPU servers, making it an ideal choice for companies running demanding AI and machine learning workloads. We currently manage hundreds of GPU nodes and reduce costs by up to 80% when compared to other solutions.
- **Seamless Updates and Maintenance:** Syself Autopilot goes beyond standard maintenance by implementing a new Kubernetes operator designed to handle the lifecycle of cluster add-ons. This operator ensures that even during updates, there is no downtime, enabling 100% replication of the cluster for thorough testing. This innovative approach won a tender from the German government to build a Kubernetes-as-a-Service platform, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness.
- **Comprehensive Global Support and Partnership:** We bring deep expertise in Kubernetes management, coupled with a close relationship with Hetzner, to provide unparalleled support to our partners. Our global team of DevOps experts and Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), spanning four continents, is available 24/7 on your fingertips to ensure a reliable service.

Syself Autopilot is well-suited for organizations seeking a robust, scalable, and automated Kubernetes management solution.

## üåç Open-Source and Syself

From the beginning, Syself has been a fervent supporter of open-source technologies and contributions. We are motivated by our active contributions to the Kubernetes project family, especially in projects like [cluster-api](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api).

### üõ†Ô∏è Our Projects

Our work includes partnerships with infrastructure providers like Hetzner and Hivelocity, and European-funded projects like Sovereign Cloud Stack:

- **[Cluster API Provider Hetzner](https://github.com/syself/cluster-api-provider-hetzner)**: The Hetzner Provider allows you to run Kubernetes on [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/). The Infrastructure as Software approach allows completely declarative provisioning of your infrastructure with automatic health checks and full day 2 operations.
- **[Cluster API Provider Hivelocity](https://github.com/hivelocity/cluster-api-provider-hivelocity)**: The Hivelocity Provider lets you run Kubernetes in a declarative way on [Hivelocity](https://www.hivelocity.net/). Syself is the core maintainer.
- **[Hivelocity Cloud Controller Manager](https://github.com/hivelocity/hivelocity-cloud-controller-manager)**: Developed by Syself for the infrastructure provider Hivelocity.
- **[Helm Charts](https://github.com/syself/charts)**: Syself Helm Chart library.
- **[Cluster Stack Operator](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator)**: Works with [Cluster Stacks](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks) to create Kubernetes clusters in an easy and [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api)-native way.
- **[Csctl](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/csmctl)**: A tool used for releasing cluster stacks.
