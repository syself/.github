# **Syself – The Future of Kubernetes Management**  
🚀 **Self-Healing, Automated, and Scalable Kubernetes – On Your Terms.**  

## **What is Syself?**  
Syself is a **fully automated Kubernetes lifecycle management platform** designed to simplify, scale, and secure Kubernetes clusters without the operational burden.  

Built on **a foundation of open-source technologies like Cluster API**, Syself automates everything—from cluster creation and scaling to updates and failure recovery—so you can **focus on your applications, not your infrastructure**.  

## **Why Syself?**  
Managing Kubernetes at scale is complex. Traditional Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools like Terraform require **manual execution** and do not continuously reconcile infrastructure state. Syself changes the game by taking a **software-defined approach**:  

✅ **Automated Kubernetes Lifecycle** – Deploy, scale, and update clusters effortlessly.  
✅ **Self-Healing Infrastructure** – Nodes are monitored, replaced, and optimized in real-time.  
✅ **Built for Scale** – Whether you manage a few clusters or thousands, Syself adapts.  
✅ **Secure by Default** – Enforced best practices, automated compliance, and integrated security policies.  
✅ **Flexible Infrastructure Support** – Works seamlessly across **multi-cloud and dedicated bare-metal environments**.  

## **Key Features**  
### 🛠 **Self-Healing Kubernetes**  
Syself automatically detects and replaces failed nodes, ensuring **zero downtime** for workloads.  

### ⚡ **Declarative & GitOps-Ready**  
Your infrastructure is defined as **Kubernetes objects** (CRDs), making it auditable, reproducible, and **fully compatible with GitOps workflows**.  

### 🏗 **Automated Cluster Upgrades**  
Syself structures upgrades into safe, step-by-step processes, ensuring all dependencies are handled without breaking changes.  

### 🌍 **Multi-Cloud & Bare-Metal Server Support**  
Syself works on **Hetzner Cloud, Hetzner Bare-Metal Servers**, and will soon support additional cloud providers. Bare-metal servers offer dedicated hardware resources without virtualization overhead, providing high performance and cost efficiency.  

### 💾 **High-Performance Databases on Kubernetes**  
Run **PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, ClickHouse, Kafka, and more** with **vendor-neutral Kubernetes operators**—fully automated, scalable, and integrated with local NVMe storage.  

### 🔐 **Secure by Design**  
Syself enforces security best practices, provides **OIDC-based authentication**, and removes the need for manual **x509 certificate management**.  

## **Get Started in Minutes**  
1. **Deploy Syself Autopilot** – Spin up a cluster using **Syself’s Kubernetes-native API**.  
2. **Define Your Infrastructure** – Manage everything declaratively with YAML.  
3. **Scale & Automate** – Let Syself handle upgrades, node failures, and scaling.  

## **Contributions to the Cloud-Native Ecosystem**  
We actively contribute to open-source Kubernetes projects and collaborate with major infrastructure providers. Our work includes:
